Acessing Redmine on Truffala
============================

There are two ways you can **direct acess** Redmine on *Truffala Desktop*:

* `Redmine Frame on Landing Page <redmine_landingpage_>`_
* `The Entire Redmine Page <redmine_entirepage_>`_

.. note::
	For understand more about Redmine and its capabilities check the `Project Management <www.google.com>`_ section.

.. _redmine_landingpage:

Redmine Frame on Landing Page
*****************************

When you navigate on the `Landing Page <landing_page.html>`_ you can acess your projects trought the **Project** button. After clicking on the project you want acess, it will open a **Redmine Frame** as the follow image:

.. image:: ../static/redmineframe.png
	:align: center 

On this frame **you'll be able to do all your daily tasks** on the currently project. Examples of tasks could be: *create/report issues, organize and assign tasks, acess the gant, upload data and more.* 

.. _redmine_entirepage:

The Entire Redmine Page
***********************

For some administrative tasks you'll need to open **the entire Redmine page**. To open the Redmine on a new tab, right click on a random link on the Redmine frame and choose Open Link in New Tab. As the follow picture:

.. image:: ../static/opennewtab.png
	:align: center

You can check that the **difference** between the *Redmine Frame* and the *Entire Redmine Page* **is the bar at the top of the screen.**

.. image:: ../static/bar_redmine.png
	:align: center

Basically the two important links on this bar are **Administration** and **My account**. For example you'll use administration for create projects, create groups, ability plugins and more. And on *My account* you'll be able to change your account settings, for example the password. 

.. note:: 
	Check the `Project Management <www.google.com.br>`_ section for more information about Redmine.

.. warning::
	**TODO**:
	* Project Management section explain about Redmine and its capabilities
