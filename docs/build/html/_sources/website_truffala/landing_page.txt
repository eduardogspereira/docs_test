.. important::

        Every *workpack* you'll create must be referenced by a **Redmine Project**.

You can click on the *workpack* you want to acess and it will load on your screen with all tools enabled by the **project administrator**. Check the next example showing a workpack:

With the **workpacks** you'll be able to upload geospatial data, automate process and alerts and integrate the geospatial information with the project management.
